## PHASE 0: THE FIRST IMPRESSION (AWE-INSPIRING) ✅ IN PROGRESS

### The Problem
When users register, the experience is soulless. It asks functional questions but doesn't move the soul.

### The Solution - Emotional Onboarding
Before asking "what habits do you want?" we ask the questions that MATTER:

**Step 1: The Burning Desire**
- "What is your burning desire? The ONE thing that, if achieved, would make everything else worthwhile?"
- Forces users to confront their deepest wants
- Backed by Napoleon Hill wisdom

**Step 2: Confronting Fear**
- "What is your biggest fear? What has stopped you before?"
- Names the obstacle, takes away its power
- Backed by Stoic wisdom

**Step 3: The Vision**
- "Imagine one year from now. You've achieved it. Describe that morning."
- Creates vivid visualization
- Makes the future feel REAL

**Step 4: Philosophy Choice** (emotionally primed now)
- Choose between Napoleon Hill / James Clear / Ryan Holiday
- The choice means more because they've already done the inner work

**Step 5: The Commitment**
- Daily time investment with impact calculations
- Shows them the compounding effect of their commitment

**Step 6: The Covenant**
- Summary of everything they've declared
- Feels like signing a contract with themselves
